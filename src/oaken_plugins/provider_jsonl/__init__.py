"""JSON Lines piped in by hand, one item per line

The by-hand door: a person dumps a file in and nothing keeps it open (``socket`` is the machine's door).
One command, ``oaken jsonl ingest``: pipe a file or another tool's output into it and every line becomes one
item for triage, with the parsed JSON object as its body (or the line's text, with ``raw``). It also answers on
the API as the operation ``jsonl.ingest``. The plugin has no file watcher and no loop: the thing that makes
the lines decides when to send them.

    cat leads.jsonl | oaken jsonl ingest --yes

shortcut: no de-duplication, so piping the same file twice submits every line twice; and one call is as big as
the API's body limit (``[api] max_body_bytes``, 1 MB by default), so split a bigger file (``split -l 5000``) or
raise the limit. Upgrade when a source re-sends lines.
