"""``llm``: a model decides whether an item meets your criteria.

Ported in spirit from oaken-mail's ``triage`` plugin (which asked for a mail category, priority and reply), made
generic: you say what you are looking for, in your own words, and the model answers accept, reject or unsure with
a short reason. It runs last (rank 90): ``dedupe`` and ``rules`` settle what they can first, so the model only sees
what they could not.

    [plugins.triager.llm]
    criteria = "A company that could buy a vector database: it builds search, recommendation or RAG products."

The item is outside text: it goes to the model only as marked data, never in the instructions, and the standing
guard tells the model not to obey it. Your ``criteria`` are your own words and sit in the instructions. A
``confidential`` item never goes to a hosted backend. Answers are cached per item, criteria and model.

The backend is ``[plugins.triager.llm.route]`` (default: the ``ollama`` backend); ``escalate`` there names a bigger
model to try when this one is unsure of itself (the answer's ``confidence`` is under ``[router] min_confidence``).
``oaken llm try`` asks about a piece of text without submitting anything, to tune the criteria.

shortcut: one question per item and no learning from rejects (no ``learn``); add a junk-index option when the
owner wants rejects to teach ``nearjunk``.
